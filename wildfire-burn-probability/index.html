    <h1>Mapping burn probability in U.S. counties</h1>
    <em>
        <p>Created as part of CJS' Points Unknown Mapping class</p>
        <p>This assignment involved experimenting with different ways of classifying data in maps and then selecting one that we felt made the most sense. I decided to use natural breaks for my final map. The code for the other maps I tried, which were visualized in Altair, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ilenapeng/points-unknown-data/blob/main/wildfire-burn-probability/burn-probability.ipynb">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>These maps were also primarily exploratory — so while I did do research while making and explaining them, they weren't vetted by scientists and shouldn't be interpreted as scientific visualizations.</p>
    </em>

    <p>Burn probability shows the chance that a wildfire will occur in a given point — usually a single grid cell / pixel — in a year. 
        The number is calculated through wildfire simulations, which account for factors like topography, weather and fuel for a fire, 
        such that a burn probability of 0.001 means that the area burned 1 out of 1,000 times in the simulation, according to a 2013 report from the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr315.pdf">United States Department of Agriculture / Forest Service</a> and <a href="https://iftdss.firenet.gov/firenetHelp/help/pageHelp/content/20-models/lbp/out/burnprob.htm">the Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>This map displays the average burn probability of the single grid cells in each county. These probabilities, which are often small, are communicated in this map as a ratio, as suggested by the 2013 USDA/FS report. A burn probability of 0.001 is 1 burning pixel to 1,000 simulations, or a 1 in 1,000 chance of fire.

    <p>Click on a county to view the mean burn probability, or the average annual chance of a fire occurring in a single grid cell in that county.</p>
